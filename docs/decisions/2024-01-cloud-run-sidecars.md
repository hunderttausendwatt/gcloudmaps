# Decision Log

In this project I capture important decisions with [architectural decision records](https://adr.github.io/),
based on the [Emblem Given Project](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/emblem)

These records provide context, trade-offs, and reasoning taken at our community & technical cross-roads. My goal is to preserve the understanding of how the project has grown, and capture enough insight to effectively revisit previous decisions.

Get started created a new decision record with the template:

```sh
cp template.md YYYY-MM-title-with-dashes.md
```
